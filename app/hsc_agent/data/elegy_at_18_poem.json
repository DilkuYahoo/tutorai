  "poem": "Elegy at 18\nBy Aloma Davis\nIf you take an object from a scale, it is lighter.\nHow, then, can an absence be so heavy?\nYour loss is stony ballast dragging me under.\nFrom now on I will shoulder a calendar of days\nmonths, years, decades leaden with your loss.\nThose who questioned you during your life\nface a new grammatical challenge in your death;\nhow to describe you in the past tense.\nI cannot do it yet. You are the epitome of the present continuous.\nI am certain your pirate smile will still flash around the corner;\nyour velvet eyes meet mine. Denial shimmers on my road.\nAquaplaning through my days,\nI refuse to see the crash I know is coming.\nI have been so proud of you I can barely speak.\nIf only you could feel them; if my wings could enfold you safe.\nGuilt fills me with demented rage that has no target but myself.\nIn the trail of your death, their silence is ear-splitting.\nTheir startled eyes slide away from mine and I see their mirage,\nthe way they swerve. It is their own past that makes them tense.\nI know, soon, I must confess the outrageous truth.\nI will correct myself and say what we have been swallowing:\n\u201cyou were, you were.\u201d But today, our fierce, sweet and clever one,\nbe present with us a moment more. Stay with me,\nand let me love you for all that you are.",
