                <p>Dear <strong>reinventure team</strong>,</p>
                <p>I hope you’re doing well. I’m reaching out to introduce <strong>AdviceGenie</strong>, an AI-powered financial advice platform addressing the growing gap in accessible and affordable financial guidance. With traditional financial advice costing upwards of <strong>$3,000</strong> per Statement of Advice (SoA), our pay-per-use model (<strong>$20 per session</strong>) makes high-quality financial advice available to millions of unadvised Australians.</p>
                
                <p>Our platform is now ready for testing. Try it at <a href="https://advicegenie.com.au" class="btn btn-primary">advicegenie.com.au</a>. For strategic financial planning networks, visit <a href="https://advicegenie.com.au/advice.html" class="btn btn-secondary">advicegenie for advisors</a>. We are at the stage where I need to bring in customers to start using it.</p>
                
                <p>We are currently raising <strong>$2M - $5M</strong> at a <strong>$10M - $20M</strong> valuation, with a strict equity cap of <strong>10%</strong>. Instead of just funding, we are seeking strategic investors who can help us secure partnerships with financial advisers, <strong>Trading Partners</strong>, and financial institutions to drive rapid user acquisition.</p>
                
                <p>Given <strong>reinventure</strong>’s experience in FinTech and AI-driven platforms, I’d love to discuss how AdviceGenie aligns with your investment thesis. Let me know if you’d be open to a brief call next week.</p>
                
                <p>Looking forward to your thoughts.</p>
                
                <p>Best regards,<br>
                <strong>David K</strong><br>
